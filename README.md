gh_fetch
========
###Downloader and updater for your github repos.


- Did you ever need to update a ton of repositories from GitHub but you had to do it one by one?
- Did you ever need to start using your dev machine quickly but had to clone repos one by one?
- Did you ever needed to keep a backup of a large number of GitHub repos?

**gh_fetch** is designed to fix all of these problems by automating the process to the maximum extent possible. This tool will go through your (or another account's) GitHub repos both public and private including repositories from organizations you are a member of and fetch the most recent changes for it, cloning the relevant repos if they are not already downloaded. Feature set will be expanding per my current needs but you are free to fork and issue a pull request.

```

$ ./update_repos -h
